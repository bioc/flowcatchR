CHANGES IN VERSION 1.0.3 (2015-02-03)
--------------------------------------

NEW FEATURES

	o addTrajectory: changed implementation in the addTrajectory function, notable gain in computing 
	time
	o particles: implementation of particles() now used BiocParallel - massive gain in performances!
	o snap() function to allow interaction of the user with the image, to display additional 
	information on the trajectories identified on the Frames/ParticleSet
	o shinyFlow() released! A Shiny App is delivered along with the package, documentation is 
	available to guide exploration of data and parameters
	o Jupyter/IPython notebooks available in the installed folder of the package - provided as 
	template for further analysis
	o Vignette: updated to reflect the current implementation and newest features
	o preprocess.Frames: extended documentation
	o BiocViews: added a couple of terms that fit better with current status of the package



CHANGES IN VERSION 1.0.2 (2015-01-09)
--------------------------------------

BUG FIXES

	o select.Frames: fixed behaviour in select.Frames when selecting a single frame
	o add.contours: corrected bug in add.contours for grayscale images, was preventing correct combining of images. now uses correctly false colours and aids identification
	o particles: for computing particles,added check whether dimnames is set or not. previously it raised an error, but it was kind of overkilling
	o fixed behaviour in export.Frames
	o typos fixed

	

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.0.1 (2014-11-21)
--------------------------------------

BUG FIXES

	o Vignette: fixed typos, fixed parameter names in the preprocessing steps
	o read.Frames: additional check on the existence of all files
	o Grayscale images can now be directly preprocessed by selecting channel = "all"

NEW FEATURES

	o Added url for development version on github.
		Active development is performed there, therefore feel free to send pull requests/
		feature wishes (https://github.com/federicomarini/flowcatchR/issues)!
	o Added integration of the repository with Travis-CI	
	o add.contours: if image is in grayscale, use false colours to enhance detected particles
	o plot2d.TrajectorySet is now able to draw a grid and help backtracking points from the 
		trajectories
