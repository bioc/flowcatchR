**shinyFlow** is a complementary tool to flowcatchR for *put what needs to be there*

Put an intro to flowcatchR? maybe a couple of words on what we can do here?

The **shinyFlow** application is based on the package **flowcatchR**, and a large part of the source code is inspired by the work done by the **flowcatchR**'s authors. 


**shinyFlow** is currently developed at IMBEI by Federico Marini, under the supervision of Harald Binder and Johanna Mazur. Many thanks to Sven Jäckel, Kerstin Jurk and Mareike Döhrmann for providing test datasets and feedback on the features to implement.
