\description{
Launches a Shiny Web Application for interactive data exploration. Default data loaded are
the frames from the \code{MesenteriumSubset} object, custom values can be inserted by typing
the location of the data stored in a local folder. The Application is structured in a variety
of tabs that mirror the steps in the usual workflow in time-lapse microscopy images. These can
allow the user to interactively explore the parameters and their effect in the reactive
framework provided by Shiny.
