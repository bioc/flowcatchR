# TRAJECTORY ANALYSIS
# The final stage in any time-lapse microscopy imaging experiment is the analysis of the trajectories re- sulting from cell or particle tracking, to confirm or reject predefined 
# hypotheses about object dynamics, or to discover new phenomena. Qualitative analysis by visual inspection of computed trajectories may already give hints about trends in the data,
# but usually does not provide much more information than can be obtained by directly looking at the image data itself, or projections thereof. Quantitative anal- yses of the 
# trajectories are required in order to achieve higher sensitivity in data interpretation and to be able to perform statistical tests. Of course, what parameters to measure and 
# analyze depends very much on the research questions underlying a specific experiment. Here we briefly discuss examples of meas- urements frequently encountered in the literature.
# 
# Geometry Measurements
# Once the objects of interest in an image sequence are detected, segmented, and associated, a multitude of measures concerning the geometry of the resulting trajectories as well
# as the objects themselves can readily be computed. An example is the maximum relative distance to the initial position reached by the object [27,28,57]. Other examples are the
# length of the trajectory, or the total distance traveled by the object, and the distance between start and end point, or the net distance traveled [12]. The latter measures 
# relate to the so-called McCutcheon index [32,91], which is often used in chemotaxis studies to quantify the efficiency of cell movements, and is defined as the ratio between 
# the net distance moved in the direction of increasing chemoattractant concentration and the total distance moved. Derived pa- rameters, such as the directional change per 
# time interval and its autocorrelation [129,154], are indica- tive of the directional persistence and memory of a translocating cell. Information about the cell con- tour 
# or surface at each time point allow the computation of a variety of shape features, such as diame- ter, perimeter and area, or surface area and volume, circularity or 
# sphericity, convexity or concavity [129], elongation or dispersion [33], and their changes over time.
# 
# Diffusivity Measurements
# A very frequently studied parameter, especially in particle tracking experiments, is the mean square displacement (MSD) [4,6,16,35,54,72,74,78,89,115]. It is a convenient
# measure to study the diffusion characteristics of the motion of individual particles [104,119,134] and also allows to assess the viscoe- lastic properties of the media in
# which they move [140,141,134]. By definition, the MSD is a function of time lag, and the shape of the MSD-time curve for a given trajectory is indicative of the mode of 
# motion of the corresponding particle (Figure 4). For example, in the case of pure or normal diffusion by thermally driven Brownian motion, the MSD will increase linearly 
# as a function of time, where the dif- fusion constant determines the slope of the line. In the case of flow or active transport, on the other hand, the MSD will increase 
# more rapidly and in a nonlinear fashion. The contrary case of anomalous subdiffusion, characterized by a lagging MSD-time curve compared to normal diffusion, occurs if the
# motion is not free but impeded by obstacles. Confined motion, caused by corrals or tethering or other restrictions, manifests itself by a converging curve, where the 
# limiting MSD value is proportional to the size of the region accessible for diffusion. Mathematically, the MSD is the second-order moment of displacement. A more complete
# characterization of a diffusion process is obtained by computing all moments of displacement up to some order [43,120].
# Some prudence is called for in diffusivity measurements. In isotropic media, where the displacements in each of the three spatial dimensions may be assumed to be 
# uncorrelated, the 2D diffusion coefficient is equal to the 3D diffusion coefficient [134]. In practical situations, however, it may be unknown a priori whether isotropy 
# can be assumed. In this context we recall our warning remarks regarding 2D versus 3D motion analysis [35,152,166] and stress again the importance of experimental verification
# of oneâ€™s assumptions. Furthermore, the diffusivity of a particle may depend on the diameter of the particle compared to the microstructure of the biological fluid in 
# which it moves. Here, a distinction must be made between microscopic, mesoscopic, and macroscopic diffusion [134]. Also, in the case of normal diffusion, the relation 
# between the slope of the MSD-time line and the diffusion constant strictly holds only for infinite trajectories [104]. The shorter the trajectories, the larger the 
# statistical fluctuations in the diffusivity measurements, and the higher the relevance of studying distributions of diffusion con- stants rather than single values. 
# But even for very long trajectories, apparent subdiffusion patterns may arise at short time scales, caused solely by the uncertainty in particle localization in noisy
# images [89]. Finally, care must be taken in computing the MSD over an entire trajectory, as it may obscure transi- tions between diffusive and nondiffusive parts [119].
# 
# Velocity Measurements
# Another commonly studied parameter in time-lapse imaging experiments is velocity [10,29,32,57,90, 127,153]. It is computed simply as distance over time. Instantaneous 
# object velocity can be estimated as the distance traveled from one frame to the next divided by the time interval. Average velocity, also referred to as curvilinear 
# velocity, is then computed as the sum of the frame-to-frame distances trav- eled, divided by the total time elapsed. If the temporal sampling rate is constant, this
# is the same as av- eraging the instantaneous velocities. The so-called straight-line velocity, another type of average veloc- ity, is computed as the distance between
# the first and last trajectory position divided by the total elapsed time. The ratio between the latter and the former, known as the linearity of forward progression 
# [70,84,162], is reminiscent of the McCutcheon index mentioned above. Histograms of velocity [10,32, 88,104,144,145,146] are often helpful in gaining insight into motion
# statistics. Object acceleration can also be estimated from velocity but is rarely studied [129].
# 
# Several warning remarks are in order regarding velocity estimation. In the case of cell tracking, motion analysis is tricky, due to the possibility of morphological
# changes over time. Often, to circumvent the problem, a center position is tracked [25,29,45,63,70,83,84,153,162]. In the case of highly plastic cells, however, 
# centroid based velocity measurements can be very deceptive [129]. For example, an anchored cell may extend and retract pseudopods, thereby continuously changing
# its centroid position and gener- ating significant centroid velocity, while the cell is not actually translocating. In the contrary case, a cell may spread in 
# all directions at high velocity in response to some stimulant, while the cell centroid position remains unchanged. Another warning concerns the accuracy of velocity
# estimation in relation to the temporal sampling rate [129]. The higher this rate, the more detailed the movements are cap- tured, and the closer the velocity 
# estimates will approach the true values. Statistically speaking, as the sampling rate decreases, velocities will on average be increasingly underestimated.
